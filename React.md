## Component
In React, a component is a reusable, self-contained piece of code that represents a part of a user interface (UI). Components are the building blocks of React applications, and they encapsulate the logic and presentation of a particular part of the UI. React applications are typically composed of multiple components arranged in a hierarchy.

There are two main types of components in React:

1. **Functional Components:**
   - Also known as stateless components or presentational components.
   - Defined as JavaScript functions.
   - Receives props (short for properties) as input and returns React elements to describe the UI.
   - No internal state or lifecycle methods.

   Example:
   ```jsx
   const MyFunctionalComponent = (props) => {
     return <div>{props.message}</div>;
   };
   ```

2. **Class Components:**
   - Also known as stateful components.
   - Defined as ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`.
   - Can have internal state and can implement lifecycle methods.
   - More suitable for complex components with internal state or logic.

   Example:
   ```jsx
   class MyClassComponent extends React.Component {
     constructor(props) {
       super(props);
       this.state = { count: 0 };
     }

     render() {
       return <div>{this.state.count}</div>;
     }
   }
   ```

Components can be composed and nested, forming a tree-like structure. The parent component can pass data (props) to its child components, and child components can communicate with the parent via callbacks.

Here's an example of a simple React component structure:

```jsx
// Parent component
const App = () => {
  const message = "Hello, React!";
  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="My App" />
      <Content message={message} />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
};

// Child components
const Header = (props) => {
  return <header>{props.title}</header>;
};

const Content = (props) => {
  return <p>{props.message}</p>;
};

const Footer = () => {
  return <footer>&copy; 2023 My App</footer>;
};
```

This structure demonstrates how components can be composed to create a complete UI. Each component is responsible for a specific part of the UI or functionality, promoting modularity and maintainability in React applications.


## JSX
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is commonly used with React to describe what the UI should look like. It allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files, making it more readable and expressive when defining React elements.

In JSX, you can write tags similar to HTML, but these tags represent React components. JSX gets transformed into JavaScript objects called "React elements" during the build process. It provides a more concise and familiar syntax for defining the structure of the UI in React applications.

Here's a simple example of JSX:

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

In the above example, `<h1>` and `</h1>` look like HTML tags, but they are JSX syntax. The code is creating a React element representing an `<h1>` heading with the text "Hello, React!".

Key features of JSX:

1. **Embedding Expressions:**
   You can embed JavaScript expressions within JSX using curly braces `{}`. This allows you to dynamically include values or expressions in your JSX.

   ```jsx
   const name = "John";
   const greeting = <p>Hello, {name}!</p>;
   ```

2. **Attributes and Props:**
   JSX supports HTML-like attributes for components. These attributes are passed as props (properties) to the corresponding React components.

   ```jsx
   const button = <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
   ```

3. **HTML-Like Syntax:**
   JSX closely resembles HTML, making it more readable and approachable for developers who are familiar with web development.

   ```jsx
   const form = (
     <form>
       <label htmlFor="username">Username:</label>
       <input type="text" id="username" />
     </form>
   );
   ```

4. **Self-Closing Tags:**
   You can use self-closing tags for elements that don't have a closing tag, like in HTML.

   ```jsx
   const image = <img src="image.jpg" alt="An example" />;
   ```

It's important to note that while JSX looks similar to HTML, it's not actually HTML. JSX is a syntactic sugar for `React.createElement` calls, creating React elements that are used by the React library to render components. JSX makes it easier to work with React components and helps maintain a more declarative and readable code structure.


## props
In React, "props" is a short form for "properties," and it refers to the mechanism by which data is passed from a parent component to its child components. Props allow you to pass values and data to a React component, enabling the component to render dynamically based on the provided information.

Here's a basic example of using props in a React component:

```jsx
// ParentComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

const ParentComponent = () => {
  const message = 'Hello from Parent!';

  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent greeting={message} />
    </div>
  );
};

// ChildComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';

const ChildComponent = (props) => {
  return <p>{props.greeting}</p>;
};

export default ChildComponent;
```

In this example:

1. The `ParentComponent` has a variable `message` containing the string 'Hello from Parent!'.
2. The `ParentComponent` renders the `ChildComponent` and passes the `message` as a prop called `greeting`.
3. The `ChildComponent` receives the `greeting` prop and renders a paragraph (`<p>`) element containing the value of the prop.

Props are read-only, meaning that a child component cannot modify the props it receives from its parent. They are a way to establish communication between components, allowing you to create dynamic and reusable components.

Common use cases for props in React include:

1. **Passing Data:** Passing data from a parent component to a child component for rendering or processing.

2. **Configuring Components:** Configuring the behavior or appearance of a child component by passing various props.

3. **Event Handling:** Passing callback functions as props to child components to handle events.

Props play a crucial role in building modular and reusable components in React, as they allow you to create flexible and dynamic user interfaces.


## state (useState)
In React, "state" refers to the data that a component manages and can change over time. It is a way for a React component to keep track of and re-render with updated data. State allows components to have dynamic behavior and respond to user interactions.

The `useState` hook is a React hook that enables functional components to manage state. It is part of the Hooks API introduced in React 16.8, providing a way to use state in functional components instead of class components.

Here's a basic example of using `useState` in a functional component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  // useState returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state.
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => {
    // The setCount function is used to update the state.
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

In this example:

1. The `useState(0)` hook is used to initialize a state variable named `count` with an initial value of `0`.
2. The `setCount` function is a updater function provided by `useState` that allows you to modify the `count` state.
3. The component renders the current value of `count` and a button. When the button is clicked, the `increment` function is called, updating the `count` state.

Key points about `useState`:

- The `useState` function returns an array where the first element is the current state value, and the second element is the updater function.
- You can use multiple `useState` hooks in a single component to manage different pieces of state.
- The initial state can be a primitive value, an object, or even a function.

Using `useState` allows functional components to have their own state, making them more powerful and flexible. Stateful logic is no longer exclusive to class components, and functional components can now handle complex state management using hooks.


## effect (useEffect)
In React, the `useEffect` hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects include actions like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM, and they typically happen after the initial render. The `useEffect` hook is part of the Hooks API introduced in React 16.8, and it allows you to manage side effects in functional components in a clean and declarative way.

Here's a basic example of using `useEffect`:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // The effect runs after every render and whenever the 'count' state changes.
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

In this example:

1. The `useEffect` hook takes two arguments: a function containing the code for the side effect and an array of dependencies.
2. The effect sets the document title to include the current count value whenever the count changes.
3. The dependency array `[count]` ensures that the effect runs only when the `count` state changes.

Key points about `useEffect`:

- The function passed to `useEffect` is the effect itself. It can contain asynchronous code, subscriptions, or any other side effect.
- The second argument, the dependency array, is optional. It determines when the effect should run. If the array is empty, the effect runs only once after the initial render. If the array contains values, the effect runs whenever any of those values change.
- If the dependency array is omitted, the effect runs after every render.

Here are common use cases for `useEffect`:

1. **Fetching Data:**
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     const fetchData = async () => {
       const result = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
       // Process the fetched data
     };
     fetchData();
   }, []); // Empty dependency array means it runs once after the initial render.
   ```

2. **Subscriptions:**
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     const subscription = subscribeToSomeEvent(() => {
       // Handle the event
     });
     return () => {
       // Cleanup function to unsubscribe when the component unmounts or the dependency changes.
       subscription.unsubscribe();
     };
   }, [dependency]);
   ```

3. **DOM Manipulation:**
   ```jsx
   useEffect(() => {
     // Perform some DOM manipulation
     const element = document.getElementById('myElement');
     element.style.color = 'red';
   }, []);
   ```

The `useEffect` hook provides a way to handle side effects in functional components, ensuring that the logic is executed at the right times during the component lifecycle.
